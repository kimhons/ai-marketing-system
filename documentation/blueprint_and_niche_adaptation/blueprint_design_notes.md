## UI Design Updates for Niche Adaptation and AI-Driven Blueprint Generation

**1. Intake Form:**

*   **User Experience:** The intake form should be presented as a guided questionnaire, possibly broken down into sections (e.g., business details, target audience, marketing goals).
*   **Input Fields:** Include fields for all the questions identified in the previous step (e.g., business name, industry, target audience demographics, marketing budget, desired outcomes).
*   **Progress Indicator:** Show users their progress through the form to manage expectations.
*   **Save and Continue:** Allow users to save their progress and return later if needed.
*   **Clear Call to Action:** A prominent button to submit the form once completed.

**2. Blueprint Display:**

*   **Visual Representation:** The generated blueprint should be presented in a clear, easy-to-understand format. This could involve a combination of text, charts, and diagrams.
*   **Key Sections:** The blueprint should clearly outline:
    *   **Business Overview:** Summarize the information provided by the user.
    *   **Target Audience Profile:** Detail the characteristics of the ideal customer.
    *   **Marketing Objectives:** List the specific goals the user wants to achieve.
    *   **Recommended Strategies:** Present the AI-generated strategies, including channel suggestions, content themes, and campaign ideas.
    *   **Action Plan:** Provide a step-by-step plan for implementing the recommended strategies.
*   **Interactivity:** Allow users to interact with the blueprint, perhaps by clicking on different sections to get more detailed information or make adjustments.

**3. Integration with Existing UI:**

*   **Dashboard Integration:** The user's dashboard should display a summary of their blueprint and provide easy access to the detailed view.
*   **Campaign Creation:** When creating new marketing campaigns, the system should leverage the blueprint information to pre-fill relevant fields and suggest strategies.
*   **Analytics and Reporting:** The performance of campaigns should be tracked against the goals outlined in the blueprint.

## Backend API Design Changes:

**1. Intake Form API:**

*   **Endpoint:** `/api/intake`
*   **Method:** POST
*   **Request Body:** JSON object containing the answers to the intake form questions.
*   **Response:** Confirmation message or error if validation fails.

**2. Blueprint Generation API:**

*   **Endpoint:** `/api/blueprint/generate`
*   **Method:** POST
*   **Request Body:** User ID or relevant identifier to link the blueprint to the user's account.
*   **Response:** The generated blueprint in a structured format (e.g., JSON).

**3. Campaign Management API (Updates):**

*   **Endpoint:** `/api/campaigns`
*   **Request Body (for creating/updating campaigns):** Include fields for strategy selection, allowing users to link campaigns to specific strategies from their blueprint.
*   **Response (for retrieving campaigns):** Include strategy information for each campaign.

**4. User Profile API (Updates):**

*   **Endpoint:** `/api/users/{userId}`
*   **Response Body:** Include a field for the user's blueprint ID or the blueprint itself.

This initial outline provides a starting point. Further details will be added as we progress through the design and development phases.
