    - [ ] Scaffold the AI Agent Orchestration Layer (e.g., using Cloud Run or GKE) - *This will host the AI Adaptation Agent and other agents.*
- [ ] **Database Setup (GCP & Firebase):**
    - [x] Provision relational database using Google Cloud SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL) and apply initial schema.
    - [x] Design initial database schema for core entities (users, leads, campaigns, system config) - *To be expanded for intake data & blueprints.*
    - [ ] Set up Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore for NoSQL requirements and Vertex AI Matching Engine for vector similarity search.
- [ ] **Logging & Monitoring Basics (Google Cloud Operations Suite):**
    - [x] Implement basic logging across initial services using Cloud Logging.
    - [x] Set up initial monitoring dashboards for infrastructure health using Cloud Monitoring (Documentation for manual setup provided in `monitoring_setup.md`).
## Phase 1.5: Business Blueprint System - Core Development
- [ ] **Develop Business Intake Form Module:**
    - [x] Implement UI for the ~20 nuanced questions.
    - [x] Develop backend API endpoints to securely receive and store intake form data.
- [ ] **Develop AI Adaptation Agent - MVP:**
    - [ ] Implement core logic for processing intake form data.
    - [ ] Develop initial algorithms/rules for generating a basic business blueprint structure.
    - [ ] Integrate with LLM APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.) for advanced analysis and generation.
    - [ ] Define initial data model for storing generated blueprints.
- [ ] **Develop Blueprint Management Module (Dashboard):**
    - [ ] Implement UI for presenting generated business blueprints.
    - [ ] Develop backend API endpoints for storing, retrieving, and managing blueprint lifecycle.
- [ ] **Initial Integration of Blueprints with Core Modules (Proof of Concept):**
    - [ ] Adapt a small segment of the Lead Generation module to consider a basic blueprint insight.
    - [ ] Modify a basic Marketing Campaign setup to be influenced by a blueprint strategy.
