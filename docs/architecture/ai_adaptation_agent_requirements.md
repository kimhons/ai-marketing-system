# AI Adaptation Agent: Detailed Requirements

## 1. Introduction

The AI Adaptation Agent is a central component of the AI Marketing System. It serves a dual role:

1.  **For Small Businesses:** To process detailed information provided through the Business Intake Form, analyze it using AI and LLM capabilities, and generate a comprehensive, actionable Business Blueprint. This blueprint will guide the business in its marketing strategies, lead generation efforts, and overall growth.
2.  **For Customers/End-Users:** To act as an intelligent matching engine that connects customers seeking specific products or services with relevant small businesses registered within the system. This facilitates lead generation for businesses and provides value to customers by simplifying their search.

This document outlines the detailed requirements for the AI Adaptation Agent, covering both its business-facing and customer-facing functionalities.

## 2. Business-Facing Role: Business Blueprint Generation

This role focuses on transforming raw business data into strategic marketing intelligence.

### 2.1. Data Input

*   The primary input will be the complete dataset from the Business Intake Form (as defined in `intake_form_questions_v3.md`). This includes:
    *   Business Profile & Vitals (Name, Industry, Stage, Size, Location, etc.)
    *   Goals & Aspirations (Growth, Revenue, Market Share, etc.)
    *   Target Audience Insights (Demographics, Psychographics, Pain Points)
    *   Product/Service Deep Dive (Features, Benefits, USP)
    *   Competitive Landscape (Key Competitors, Strengths, Weaknesses)
    *   Current Marketing & Sales Efforts (Channels, Budget, Performance)
    *   Brand Identity & Voice
    *   Open-ended qualitative responses providing nuanced context.

### 2.2. Processing Logic & Analysis

*   **Initial Action Plan / Roadmap:** Suggested first steps for implementation (e.g., 30-60-90 day plan).
*   **Resource & Tool Suggestions (Optional):** Relevant marketing tools or platforms.

## 3. Customer-Facing Role: Intelligent Business Matching

This role focuses on connecting end-users (customers) with businesses that meet their needs.

### 3.1. Customer Data Input

The system will require a customer-facing interface to capture their needs. Options include:

*   **Structured Query Form:** A simple form where customers select service categories, location (if relevant), and provide keywords for their needs (e.g., "liability insurance for construction worker in [City]").
*   **Natural Language Query Interface:** A search bar where customers can type their needs in natural language (e.g., "I need a plumber for a leaky faucet near downtown"). This will require more sophisticated NLP processing.
*   **Guided Questionnaire:** A short series of questions to narrow down customer requirements.

The initial implementation will focus on a **Structured Query Form** for simplicity, with a view to evolving towards natural language queries.

### 3.2. Business Data Input for Matching

The agent will leverage the stored and processed profiles of all registered small businesses. Key data points for matching include:

*   Industry and specific service categories/tags (derived from intake and potentially enhanced by AI).
*   Products/services offered (keywords, descriptions).
*   Location served (if applicable).
*   Target customer type (B2C, B2B, specific demographics if relevant and publicly stated by the business).
*   Business operating hours (if relevant).
*   Potentially, aggregated customer ratings/reviews (future enhancement).

### 3.3. Matching Algorithm

The agent will employ a multi-faceted matching algorithm:

1.  **Categorical Filtering:** Initial filtering based on broad service categories selected by the customer.
2.  **Keyword Matching:** Match keywords from the customer query against business profiles, service descriptions, and tags.
3.  **Location-Based Filtering (if applicable):** Filter businesses based on service area and customer location.
4.  **Semantic Similarity (LLM-enhanced):** Use LLMs to understand the intent behind customer queries and match it with semantically similar business offerings, even if keywords don't perfectly align.
5.  **Ranking & Scoring:** Matched businesses will be ranked based on relevance. Factors could include:
    *   Degree of keyword/semantic match.
    *   Completeness of business profile.
    *   Proximity (if location-based).
    *   (Future) User reviews, business responsiveness.

### 3.4. Output: Matched Business Results

The customer will be presented with a list of relevant businesses, including:

*   Business Name
*   Brief Description / Tagline
*   Services Offered (relevant to the query)
*   Location (if applicable)
*   Contact Information / Link to their profile/website (if available within the system)
*   A relevance score or explanation of why they were matched.

## 4. Shared Components & Data Model

*   **Unified Business Profile Database:** The PostgreSQL database will store comprehensive business profiles derived from the intake form. This data needs to be structured to efficiently serve both blueprint generation (deep analysis) and matching (quick retrieval and filtering).
    *   Key fields for matching (e.g., indexed keywords, categories, location data) should be optimized for search.
*   **Knowledge Base:** A shared knowledge base will be crucial.
    *   For blueprint generation: Marketing strategies, industry benchmarks, content ideas, KPI definitions.
    *   For matching: Business categories, service taxonomies, synonyms, common customer needs.
*   **LLM Integration Layer:** A common interface or service to interact with LLM APIs for tasks like NLP, semantic analysis, content generation, and query understanding, serving both agent roles.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Scalability:** The system must scale to accommodate a growing number of businesses and customer queries.
*   **Performance:**
    *   Blueprint Generation: Can be an asynchronous process, but results should be available within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., minutes to a few hours for complex analysis).
    *   Customer Matching: Must be near real-time (e.g., < 2-3 seconds response time).
*   **Accuracy:**
    *   Blueprints: Must be relevant, actionable, and based on sound marketing principles.
    *   Matches: Must be highly relevant to customer needs to build trust.
*   **Security:** Robust protection of all business intake data and any customer-provided information. Adherence to data privacy principles.
*   **Maintainability:** Code and architecture should be well-documented and modular for ease of updates and future enhancements.
*   **Extensibility:** The agent should be designed to easily incorporate new matching criteria, new blueprint components, or integrate with additional data sources or LLMs in the future.

## 6. LLM Integration Points

LLMs will be integral to both roles:

### 6.1. For Blueprint Generation:

*   **Qualitative Data Analysis:** Summarizing and extracting insights from open-ended intake questions.
*   **Content & Copy Generation:** Suggesting headlines, ad copy snippets, email subject lines, content ideas based on the blueprint.
*   **Strategy Brainstorming & Refinement:** Augmenting the knowledge base by providing novel strategic ideas or tailoring existing ones.
*   **Personalization:** Enhancing the personalization of blueprint recommendations.

### 6.2. For Customer Matching:

*   **Natural Language Query Understanding:** Interpreting complex or ambiguous customer queries.
*   **Semantic Search:** Matching customer needs to business offerings based on meaning rather than just keywords.
*   **Business Profile Augmentation:** Suggesting relevant tags or categories for businesses based on their descriptions to improve matchability.
*   **Generating Snippets for Matched Businesses:** Creating concise summaries of why a business is a good match for a customer's query.

## 7. Future Considerations

*   **Customer Feedback Loop for Matching:** Allow customers to rate the quality of matches, which can be used to refine the matching algorithm.
*   **Business Feedback Loop for Blueprints:** Allow businesses to provide feedback on the utility of the generated blueprints.
*   **Proactive Lead Notification for Businesses:** Alert businesses when a customer query closely matches their profile.
*   **Integration with Customer Communication Tools:** Facilitate direct communication between matched customers and businesses (e.g., through an in-app messaging system or booking feature).
